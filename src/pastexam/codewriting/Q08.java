	 * We wish to write a program that will transpose a 2D array. 
	 * Transposition occurs by making the rows of an array 
	 * become the columns and vice versa. For example:
	 *
	 *	1 2 3
	 *	4 5 6
 	 *
	 *	transposes to
	 *
	 *	1 4
	 *	2 5
	 *	3 6
	 *
	 * Complete the code below to transpose the given 
	 * array. You should create a new array 
	 * of the appropriate size and then fill it with 
	 * the appropriate values. Your code should work regardless 
	 * of the size of this array or the values that it contains.
