	 * 
	 * then your program should create an array that

	 * 
	 * Complete the code below to compute the sum of the columns 
	 * the given array. Your code should work regardless of the size of
	 * this array or the values that it contains. It is not necessary
	 * to print the result, creating the appropriate array is enough.
