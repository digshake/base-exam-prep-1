	 * We wish to write a program that will compute and

	 * For example, if you were given:
	 * 
	 * 		1 2 3
	 * 		4 5 6
	 * 		7 8 9
	 * 
	 * then your program should print 30 which is (1 + 5 + 9) + (3 + 5 + 7).
	 * 
	 * Complete the code below to compute the sum of the diagonals 
	 * the given array. Your code should work regardless of the size of
	 * this array or the values that it contains, though you may assume 
	 * that the given array will always besquare (number of rows 
	 * is equal to number of columns).
